Nature of the examination : This is the most complicated issue facing many aspirants every year. Someone might be reading and studying quite right but not in the area of examination concentration. Some even study NECO and WAEC past questions while preparing for the very post utme examination without knowing they are missing the road. Now, ask your self, how exactly does UNN post utme examination looks like?... Does it covers some o level past questions?... Do they repeat questions from past questions?... What are the exactly cogent reading materials that are suitable for preparation of UNN post utme examination???...  And many more questions you need to be asking your self concerning the nature of the examination... Self interrogation is part of learning because through that, you will get to the pathway of resolving your problems. So, the greatest threat and cause of most aspirants\' failure is the lack of knowledge concerning the nature of the examination they are preparing for. Now, based on the subheading, an answer to this trauma is studying jamb past questions.... When I said, studying jamb past questions, I didn\'t mean that you should go and cram the answers; you are being advised to study with understandings and be able to answer a similar question anywhere found. Know it that the nature of UNN post utme examination is 70% jamb past questions, 20% general knowledge on the four subjects you are writing and 10% UNN post utme past questions....\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   To be continued.... \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Don\'t forget to hit the like button.

I wishfully pleased to advise you to go for this less competitive courses because you have a greater chance to be admitted into any of them on merit list... Even after the release of the merit list, some of these below courses MUST surely be advertised for shopping and by then, there will be a competition on them because those with a higher average than u, will surely like to shop into any of the course according to their jamb subject combinations and by doing so, u with a small average score will start having a narrow possibility to be admitted into any of the below course...  So, I advise u, if you have a jamb score ranging from 200 to 220 and u are aspiring for a competitive course, this is an opportunity for you to decide on ur faith whether to risk ur hard earned score or to secure it...

This simple sentence is not something hard to understand in the sense that he\'s for the people that voted for him and also for the people that didn\'t vote for him... What is hard to understand in that statement??? Now From what he said concerning the youth of this country, Mr.  President simply said: Nigerian youths are after already made things... Nobody wants to work and majority depend on oil products of the country... That nobody wants to work his way out... And if this continues this way, what would be the fate of the upcoming generation??? and this might render the upcoming generation into laziness... And not that the Nigerian youths are lazy...

England internationals Kane and Alli responded to recent criticism -- which has surprised their manager Mauricio Pochettino -- with goals either side of half-time, as Spurs strengthened their grip on fourth place with three matches to play.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Watford remain on 38 points, likely enough for another season in the top flight -- but too close for comfort.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   After a week in which Spurs have faced questions about their ability to match the elite clubs and win silverware, they actually did what top clubs often do: win without playing well. Despite Chelsea moving to within two points of Spurs at the weekend, the hosts were sluggish and disjointed throughout.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The opening exchanges were littered with mistakes from both sides, so it was fitting that Tottenham\'s breakthrough came from a glaring error. Kieran Trippier\'s cross looked comfortable for Osteris Karnezis but at the last moment Christian Kabasele darted in front of the goalkeeper, who spilled the ball at the feet of Christian Eriksen. The Dane had to think quickly, nimbly nicking the ball away from Karnezis with a dancer\'s touch and squaring for Alli to sweep into an unguarded net.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The goal did little to restore Spurs\' rhythm and another sloppy mistake gifted Watford the chance to equalise. Eric Dier\'s misplaced pass was seized on by former Spur Etienne Capoue, making his 100th Watford appearance, who released Andre Gray.

(59, 1, '59.jpg', 'Bayern urges Key Striker Lewandowski to be the match decider in Madrid', '\n<p>\n   If Bayern are to stage a successful comeback for the first time in their history after a first-leg home defeat at Champions League level, helpful refereeing, a strong blue-collar ethos and good fortune are unlikely to be enough, however. They will also need their star man Robert Lewandowski to turn up, at last.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   As Rummenigge pointed out in light of the criticism that was directed at the Polish striker last week, Lewandowski is having a very good season by objective standards. Thirty-eight goals in 43 games (preseason Super Cup excluded) so far leave little to be desired. \"He\'s a goal machine,\" Rummenigge, himself a superb former forward, said. Only the fabled Gerd Muller, Bayern\'s best-ever striker managed a better hit rate (0.9 goals per game) than Lewandowski has mustered. He\'s averaged a quite spectacular 0.78 goals per game since joining the Reds in 2014.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Yet the debate surrounding the 29-year-old is not quite as \"ridiculous\" as the Bayern boss suggested.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The ex-Borussia Dortmund striker, signed on a free after a year-long pursuit, was meant to be the missing piece in a puzzle of near-world-class players. Bayern had always had top midfielders and defenders, and in the 2013 Treble-winning team, they had two of the best wingers in the game, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. Lewandowski was the first forward since the heyday of Rummenigge in the early \'80s who was coveted by the biggest clubs in the world -- the goal machine that would deliver more European trophies, as Bayern believed.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   He was bought for nights like Dortmund\'s semifinal with Real Madrid in 2013, when he scored four times, and nights like Tuesday, when Bayern need goals against the world\'s most efficient club team, with a depleted squad in a hostile environment, and with a referee in charge who might not favour them.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   In the 2015 semifinal against Barcelona, Lewandowski played with a mask after a clash of heads and wasn\'t quite himself, missing a chance in the 3-0 defeat that proved very costly. A year later at the same stage, he was on target for the winning goal in the 2-1 win vs. Athletico Madrid, but Bayern were knocked out on away goals after Thomas Muller missed a penalty. No blame whatsoever can be attached to the Poland international for last season\'s quarterfinal exit against Real Madrid; a shoulder injury stopped him from playing in the first leg, and he wasn\'t really in any position to influence the second leg either. His side were knocked out 4-2 in extra time.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It would be grossly unfair to point the finger at the striker for any of those past reversals, but public opinion will be less charitable if he is once again a non-entity on Tuesday. His failure to get on the score sheet despite having at least one clear run at goal last week, although lamentable, was not even the biggest concern. Former Bayern keeper Oliver Kahn noted that Lewandowski needed \"to be seen more\" in a game of such magnitude. He had indeed looked uncharacteristically passive and ineffective in the build-up play, just as he had done in the previous round against Sevilla.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Lewandowski without goals can still be a formidable presence, creating space for others and linking up play with runners from deep. But in the Madrid game, he had cut a forlorn figure, playing within himself, in splendid isolation from his teammates. The match had passed him by.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   On the eve of the second leg, Jupp Heynckes was forced to deny rumours that the centre-forward had left an underwhelming impression in training, too. \"He\'s been training well,\" the 72-year-old insisted, before revealing that he had sought out Lewandowski for a talk. Whether he\'s been unsettled by incessant talk about a move away from Sabener Strasse in the summer or simply out of form is impossible to say.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   For Bayern, though, the upshot is the same. They need goals, and they\'ll need them from him -- Robben is out, Ribery is ageing and Muller will be stationed out wide on the right in place of Robben. All their courage, hard work and fight will come to nothing if Lewandowski doesn\'t step up to force the issue.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-01 06:39:19', 'APPROVED'),
(60, 1, '60.jpg', 'Bayern injury list may cost them CL glory', '\n<p>\n   Real Madrid\'s second goal against Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-final first leg was a goal of what ifs: What if Manuel Neuer was in goal instead of Sven Ulreich? What if David Alaba had been fit to start instead of Rafinha? What if Jerome Boateng was able to stay on the pitch?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   And then later, when Bayern continued to miss great chances in front of goal: What if Arjen Robben did not go off injured? What if Sandro Wagner could have come off the bench? What if Corentin Tolisso was available? What if Arturo Vidal and Kingsley Coman were able to feature in either leg?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   What if 2017-18 was the year injuries cost Bayern Munich the Champions League?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   With such an extensive list of casualties, Jupp Heynckes\' side always faced an uphill battle getting anything from their first leg in Munich. Forced to start with 35-year-old Franck Ribery and 34-year-old Robben due to the continued absence of bright young winger Kingsley Coman, Bayern were already without their preferred attacking line-up.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Then an early injury saw Robben last just eight minutes before being forced off. Thiago came on in his place, with Thomas Muller shifted out wide in the absence of a proper out-and-out winger. Uncharacteristically, Thiago was sloppy in possession, while Muller failed to make an impact from the wing.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Even that decision was forced upon Heynckes, who was unwilling to use the more attacking-minded Corentin Tolisso, as the club\'s record signing was not yet fully fit following a shin injury and could only play the last 15 minutes. Vidal would have been another option instead of Thiago, but an injury in training ruled him out for the rest of the season.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Boateng also pulled up injured during the first half in Munich, worsening an already deep injury crisis for Bayern. It meant that by the 34th minute, Heynckes had used up two of his three substitutions, ripping up his gameplan in the process.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   With Robert Lewandowski misfiring in front of goal, Bayern could have called upon backup striker Wagner, who has been in excellent form since joining in January, with eight goals in 12 appearances.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Madrid\'s winner in the first leg came from poor decision-making from Rafinha, a right-back forced to play on the left due to Alaba\'s absence. A left-footed player probably would have not made the same error, as he would have spotted the danger inside and not gifted the ball to Real, who broke quickly to score past Ulreich. Additionally, Boateng\'s pace may have helped him catch Marco Asensio, while four-time UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year Neuer might have done better than the flailing Ulreich.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Alaba and Tolisso are properly in contention for the second leg, while Javi Martinez has shaken off a knock to prove his fitness, but Heynckes is still without Neuer, Boateng, Vidal, Coman and Robben, all of whom are almost guaranteed starters.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Heynckes is refusing to blame the injury crisis for his team\'s failings, praising the depth of his squad in comparison to his Munich panel which won the Champions League back in 2013.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \"I have never said that important players are not there,\" the 72-year-old insisted. \"Since all teams have here and there problems.

It is true that you have to find a balance and have an inner peace.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \"That\'s what characterizes big teams. We had that in 2012-33.

Noisily, in both cases.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   This match was electric.

In poker terms, every player was all-in for the full 95 minutes.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   If people in your orbit want to talk only about the infinitesimal slip Sergio Ramos made for Bayern\'s opening goal or try to blame Corentin Tolisso for his perfectly serviceable back-pass that Sven Ulreich messed up so that Karim Benzema could put Los Blancos 2-1 up, then ask them: Was the game thrilling? Were you on the edge of your seat? Did you see the skills? Don\'t you admire the daring? Weren\'t several of the combatants utterly heroic?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Ask them. Then ask them whether they\'d like to see another game of this intensity, this complexity, this sacrifice next week.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   I guess I\'ve laid my cards on the table. When I watched the craft of Luka Modric and Toni Kroos trying the most subtle of first-touch passes to cut open the Bayern pressure, when I saw the man who looked the least \"football able\" on the pitch, Niklas Sule, stomp forward to make terrifically intelligent runs and then clever, clever centres from the touchline, it set my six senses alight.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Keylor Navas\' utterly fabulous saves from Tolisso and David Alaba -- the first was so difficult it was improbable -- weren\'t simply technically and athletically fantastic. They were stark demonstration of admirable competitive spirit and composure from a man under gigantic personal and psychological pressure.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   And his opposite number? Well, yes, he blundered. Ulreich\'s intensity of focus was left indoors when the second half started. He acted as if he expected the ball to be down the other end for a significant time, time enough for him to settle in and get ready on the pitch, instead of being ready the instant he left the dressing room after half-time.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   That\'s why poor old Ulreich took a couple of seconds to realise that he couldn\'t dive in and use his hands when Benzema tried to close down Tolisso\'s back-pass, and that hesitation when he realised his error and tried to opt for a sliding kick cost both a second Madrid goal and, ultimately, Bayern\'s place in the final.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   But not long after that dreadful blunder that will haunt and scar the 29-year-old Stuttgart-trained keeper, his nerve was once again titanium strong.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Ulreich, Kimmich and Sule wanted to play out from the back. Cristiano Ronaldo, and eventually Kroos, raced up to press them in their own penalty area. But the Germans simply reverted to the \"keep-ball chase-ball\" exercise, which in Spain is called a \"rondo,\" in order to calmly use a triangle of passes to establish freedom from the press.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Poor old Ulreich must have felt his heart bursting out of his jersey with the stress and adrenaline of possibly committing another tiny error and losing the ball in his own 6-yard box, but he controlled and passed the ball like a Bavarian Busquets. Chapeau, from me at least.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Thiago, bar once being caught in possession, controlled, turned, gyrated back the other way, fed the ball to others, showed for passes and, on two exceptional occasions, won utterly vital sprints to rob both Marcelo and Marco Asensio when failure would probably have led to a goal.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Okay, my list of credits could go on and on.

Only the title winners from each country were allowed to enter, plus the previous season\'s winner if that was a different club.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   That competition produced extraordinary stories. It yielded a wider mix of finalists, and because clubs like Nottingham Forest, Steaua Bucharest, Aston Villa and Benfica won it, there\'s a natural nostalgia for those times.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It\'s only now that Real Madrid stand a chance of equalling a 42-year-old record of one club winning three straight finals.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-02 05:49:56', 'APPROVED'),

Whether that then has an impact on how Atletico play remains to be seen.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   We knew before last week they\'re defensively strong and brilliantly organised, but the way they reacted to playing most of the game a man light shows they\'re probably capable of strangling the life out of the tie if they so decided.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   However, Arsenal\'s need to score means there will likely be chances to counterattack, and the Londoners are a team definitely brittle against opposition who can do that effectively. Wenger\'s men would be wise not to leave too much space too early, but realistically their best chance of going through is to attack.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   With Lacazette, Mkhitaryan, Aaron Ramsey, Danny Welbeck and the creativity of Mesut Ozil, they do have the potential to cause Atletico problems.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The German, in particular, is someone Arsenal need to have to have a strong game. He was criticised in the first leg despite creating six goal-scoring chances, but there is sometimes a sense that he could impose himself in big games more.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   For Arsenal, and Wenger, games don\'t get much bigger than this. A European final is the prize for victory, and if they win that the trophy and Champions League football next season would ensure a disappointing campaign domestically ended with continental success.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Ozil should be key to that. His quality is not in dispute, and creative players are often at the mercy of their supporting cast, but in order to overcome their defensive frailties, the Gunners need their attacking talents to be at the top of their game.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The former Real Madrid man should relish a return to Spain to face an old local rival, so with Lacazette scoring regularly since his comeback and Ramsey\'s ability to deliver when the stakes are high, they shouldn\'t feel inferior.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   They made life more difficult for themselves than it should have been with the way they failed to manage the first leg, but as a club Arsenal rarely do it the easy way.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The challenge now is to rise to the occasion and pull off a result that would give Wenger a shot at a fairytale ending on home soil in Lyon on May 16.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-03 10:15:13', 'APPROVED'),

(72, 1, '72.jpg', 'European trophies certainly not for Arsene Wenger', '\n<p>\n   That has been one of the problems at Arsenal during the autumn of Wenger\'s reign, which will now officially come to an end at the John Smith\'s Stadium against Huddersfield Town on May 13. For too long, they have indulged the idea that Wenger\'s way will come good in the end and silence all of those doubters who have long suspected that there was a footballing version of the Emperor\'s New Clothes being played out at the Emirates.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Now, though, the fantasy is no more. Diego Costa\'s first-half goal in the Wanda Metropolitano was enough to secure a 2-1 aggregate victory in this semifinal for Atletico Madrid and send Diego Simeone\'s team to the final.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Costa killed off any hope of a glorious farewell for Wenger, so all thoughts of a fairy-tale ending have gone.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Cold reality is now staring Arsenal in the face. The Wenger era has three games left to run -- Burnley at home, Leicester away and then the long goodbye at Huddersfield -- and the future must now be about the rebuilding job that lies ahead for the club and whomever they appoint to clear the rubble of Wenger\'s fallen empire.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Because there is no point attempting to continue the fantasy now. Wenger will be leaving behind a mess for his successor, despite the belief of some within the Emirates that the squad is a good one to inherit.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Wenger insisted after this game that his players \"can compete next year\" with the \"right additions this summer,\" but it is not merely an issue of recruiting better personnel.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   There also needs to be a completely new attitude instilled within the squad; if that happens, then there can be a future for some of those who have let the club down in recent seasons. But the new manager will find a squad that is compromised by a lack of depth and players who are under-performing or simply not good enough.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Arsenal\'s 1-0 defeat in the Spanish capital was no surprise considering Atletico\'s formidable home record, but Wenger\'s team had opportunities to hurt the hosts, yet they continually failed to take them.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   A new coach may yet drag something out of these players, but there is a mentality problem rooted in years of malaise at the club. Arsenal\'s squad is soft. The players do not rise to the occasion against better opponents and they coast, lazily at times, against weaker teams. So Wenger\'s successor must not only identify which players he believes are worth keeping because of their ability, he also has to assess which of them are strong enough mentally to play and prosper for Arsenal.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It is a big club, only Manchester United and Liverpool in England have a greater history of success than Arsenal, and they need to start punching their weight again. So where does the new coach start? What are the key issues waiting in his in-tray?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Improving the mentality is the priority, because a new mindset will set the tone.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Some of the players who have failed to deliver under Wenger could become key figures under a new man; the vast improvement of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is an example of how a player can rediscover his spark with a change of manager.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   A different voice on the touchline might encourage Mesut Ozil to try harder and work smarter, or hone Nacho Monreal\'s wayward crossing. Hector Bellerin is a player with talent who has stagnated under Wenger, but again, a new man can revive the Spanish full-back and make him the player he should be. Aaron Ramsey, Danny Welbeck and Jack Wilshere are others who can yet have a bright future, but while improving the attitude and mentality is the most important building block, new players are also absolutely vital.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   But not only players -- Arsenal need leaders, too.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   This is not a new realisation. Arsenal have lacked leaders for the best part of this decade and Wenger has chosen the players who have arrived, so he is at fault for the absence of powerful characters on the pitch. A leader at centre-half and in midfield would have a transformative effect on this team and raise the standards of those around them.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Whatever shock therapy that the new man inflicts on the squad, it will not turn Arsenal into winners and contenders straightaway. Another year in the Europa League will not help, but that is the reality that Arsenal have to deal with.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Yet, with this season\'s Europa League journey at an end, planning for the new era has to start now.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The Wenger era is done, and the end cannot come quickly enough, because every day that is wasted on the old regime is one day fewer for the new one to get working.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-04 04:43:40', 'APPROVED'),
(73, 1, '73.jpg', 'Two Managers with different style of play clashes in Stamford Bridge', '\n<p>\n   There was a time when Liverpool and Chelsea were happy to see themselves as opposites. Rewind to a rivalry that developed rapidly and vitriolically when Rafa Benitez and Jose Mourinho took charge of the two clubs. Traditional force vs. nouveaux riches, northerners vs. southerners, Champions League winners vs. Premier League champions, the two liked to prove they were the antithesis of the other.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Now, in a way, they are opposites again; in the technical areas, anyway. Antonio Conte is the anti-Jurgen Klopp. Or maybe Klopp is the anti-Conte. Whichever, more divides than unites the men who will be yards apart, barking out orders on Sunday. The Italian may sport a designer suit. The German will almost certainly be in his club tracksuit. It is a sign of his informality.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   His language is sprinkled with references to \"Hendo\", \"Milly\" and \"Bobby\". He deploys his players\' nicknames. His Chelsea counterpart often uses their surnames. Klopp exudes warmth. Conte can have a coldness.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Their attitudes seem apparent in their seasons and, perhaps, their tactics. Klopp represents incessant attacking, Conte a calculated defensiveness. Klopp\'s positivity has transmitted itself to his players and, at times, the Liverpool crowd. Their Champions League run has owed much to a sense of optimism, an idea that with shared belief and effort presents boundless opportunity. Chelsea have seemed infected by Conte\'s negativity, his bad moods reflected in their spate of red cards, his can\'t-do mentality echoed in his side\'s seeming belief from the season\'s start that they could not retain their title.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   They have set the tone. And yet if Klopp appears the maverick, he is actually more of the company man. He never criticises his club; indeed, he is often a quirkily effective front man, lending good public relations with his personality. In contrast, Conte\'s complaints about Chelsea\'s transfers have become a recurring theme. His discontent has been made public.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Conte is high maintenance, Klopp much less demanding. He demonstrates more understanding of his employers\' situation. He gives the impression he is working with them, Conte in spite of them. The summer transfer window closed without Liverpool signing a centre-back; Klopp voiced no dissent and eventually landed his preferred target, Virgil van Dijk, who had also been wanted by Chelsea. The comparison between a manager who got his preferred options -- Van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for whom Chelsea bid -- and the one who ended up with a series of compromise choices seems one to irritate Conte as, aspirationally, he has cast covetous glances at his ideal additions. Liverpool have brought in quality, Chelsea have merely signed in larger quantities.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Yet it helps Klopp\'s cause that, because he is more willing to work with the players at his disposal, he does not end up buying for buying\'s sake. If it highlights the Liverpool manager\'s greater faith in players -- and perhaps, by extension, people -- it is shown in differing approaches to squad players and youngsters alike. Conte has promoted Andreas Christensen but most of Chelsea\'s other fringe figures have been discarded and their academy products loaned out. Klopp has a homegrown 19-year-old, Trent Alexander-Arnold, starting a Champions League semi-final. Conte never gave Dominic Solanke an appearance at Chelsea; Klopp has granted him 25 for Liverpool and, if he has been underwhelming, the forward nonetheless highlights the German\'s belief in potential.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Conte looks for the finished article. Perhaps that is understandable. If he is a short-term manager and Klopp takes the long-term perspective, each is both a product of his environment and shaping it. The older man, Klopp, lasted seven years at both Mainz and Borussia Dortmund; he has a six-year contract at Anfield. He does not share Conte\'s impatience. He had less of an immediate impact but is likely to last longer. If Klopp has often felt the great lost Arsenal manager, it would have been intriguing if he would ever have taken the Chelsea job; perhaps not, given his ethos seems so different from theirs and Roman Abramovich\'s habit of sacking managers who do not win the league.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Which Conte did in his first season. One possible scenario this summer, if Real Madrid win the Champions League is that Chelsea win the FA Cup and sack Conte after two trophies in two seasons whereas Klopp cruises on at Liverpool with no silverware to show for three campaigns.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Yet both have been transformative. Conte changed Chelsea\'s tactics, altering the angles and confounding opponents with his switch to 3-4-2-1 whereas Klopp reinvented Liverpool\'s style of play, inverting the forward line, removing the specialist striker, making them narrower and faster.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-04 04:51:22', 'APPROVED'),

While the final two fixtures are certainly winnable, a trip to the Hawthorns sounds tricky given West Bromâ€™s superb form since Darren Moore was appointed caretaker manager; the Baggies have taken eight points from four matches, as many as they managed in 18 under the man Moore replaced, Alan Pardew.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   CHELSEA (CURRENT POSITION: 5TH - 66 POINTS)\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   As explained above, any hope Chelsea have of finishing in the top four rests on them getting a result against Liverpool on Sunday.

A meeting between the two at Stamford Bridge on Sunday has more riding on it than seemed likely weeks ago.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Liverpool are tiring, there\'s no doubt about it. As each game is reaching its final 15 minutes, the team is fading rapidly every time.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It wasn\'t too apparent in the last league encounter against Stoke because Paul Lambert\'s side were intent on grabbing a draw, yet even they might have snatched an unlikely winner near the end.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Liverpool would be the best team in the world if football matches lasted 75 minutes. Sadly for them they don\'t.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Looking at the bench of a club about to reach the Champions League final was an embarrassment. There have been some injuries of course, but even at full strength, Liverpool can\'t summon up the talent and ingenuity big clubs sometimes need late in games.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Their Sunday opponents called on Pedro, Willian and Alvaro Morata in their last league win against Swansea -- players who arguably should be in the first team anyway.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The Londoners have suffered from their usual post-title season slump, despite having great players and one of the world\'s top coaches.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   They\'re still perfectly capable of taking the race for fourth place to the wire though and indeed are favourites to do so given Liverpool\'s fitness problems and European responsibilities.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Stamford Bridge has been a lucky ground for the Reds of late. They\'ve certainly won there more than they\'ve lost.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   This often happens in football, as between 1990 and 2004 they couldn\'t beat Chelsea away from home once. Once the dam is cracked, so to speak, the water often just gushes through.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The rivalry was artificially stoked by a sequence of seasons in the 2000s when the clubs clashed head on in five consecutive seasons of the Champions League; once in the group stage, once in the quarterfinal and in three famous semifinals.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Honours were even. There were domestic cup clashes too, and while Liverpool were generally regarded as old football elite, Chelsea won trophy after trophy and -- like Manchester City now -- bristled indignantly whenever the old guard got in their way.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Perhaps the rise of City has somewhat diminished what was once quite a nasty rivalry, but Chelsea vs. Liverpool can still raise sparks, and Sunday will be no exception.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The last time the clubs went head-to-head for a Champions League place was before their transformation under Roman Abramovich. In May 2003, it came down to the final game of the season and Liverpool had again stumbled from a good position.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The Reds needed to win but eventually lost 2-1. For those Liverpool fans who remember such things, the current stumble sends a shiver down the spine.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   In 2000, Gerard Houllier\'s team turned a Champions League qualification certainty into abject failure in their last five games, one of which was yet another humbling trip to Stamford Bridge.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   This year the dropped league points make a bit more sense. This is more like 2005 and 2007 when Rafa Benitez rested nearly all of his first team for upcoming Champions League matches which eventually saw Liverpool win in Istanbul but lose in Athens.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Klopp hasn\'t had the luxury of resting many, with fourth still not clinched, but he may gamble on the luxury of a final home game with Brighton to help win the necessary points.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The south coast club are safe after their 1-0 win against Manchester United on Friday but looked a tough proposition. Liverpool will take any favours right now, while doing their usual trick of making an apparently safe situation completely fraught.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   This has been a very good season overall and may still have a glorious end, although Real Madrid must be favourites for the final.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   What has happened in the run-in with injuries, tiredness and a weak squad overall may act as the wake-up call everyone at the club needs.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Chelsea want the points to keep in the hunt for fourth place and will want to avenge their two home defeats against Klopp in the previous two seasons.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   One of those was an unlikely 3-1 win which served as Klopp\'s first big win as Liverpool manager. Given his squad at the time and the position Liverpool found themselves in under Brendan Rodgers, he can claim to have moved the club forward in a significant way.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The remaining few weeks will be vital in determining from what standpoint Liverpool attempt to advance further next season.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   More Champions League football next season as the holders? Or from fifth place, with a disheartening Europa League campaign to come? As always, you can\'t take your eyes off Liverpool for a second.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-05 07:42:20', 'APPROVED'),

Because goals are the most important commodity in football and Ronaldo scores them by the bucket load.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   However, in terms of overall influence on the pitch, Messi offers more than the Real Madrid man.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   These days, the Argentine is both a goalscorer and a creator for Barcelona, while his national team also rely on him to do virtually everything.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   While Cristiano has changed his game to become less of a winger and more a centre-forward these days, Messi has gone the other way.

(97, 1, '97.jpg', 'Can Chelsea make TOP 4?', '\n<p>\n   While it was gratifying to watch, Chelsea supporters had every right to feel frustrated as they witnessed their side put in a committed shift to see off Liverpool on Sunday. The 1-0 victory made it five straight wins in all competitions for the London club equalling their best run of form in what overall has been a disappointing campaign.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Should they win their remaining two Premier League games against Huddersfield Town and Newcastle United there is an outside chance that fifth-placed Chelsea could qualify for next season\'s Champions League, but that outcome requires one of Tottenham -- who currently occupy fourth place -- or third placed Liverpool dropping points.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The Blues\' destiny is largely out of their hands and should they fall short a glance at some of the nine league games they have lost will provide an unwelcome reminder of the problems they encountered during the season. Of their nine defeats to date, the 3-0 home loss to Bournemouth which was followed by a 4-1 thrashing by Watford at Vicarage Road stand out, as does the galling 3-1 beating by deadly rivals Tottenham at Stamford Bridge, the latter a game Chelsea had taken the lead in.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   If Antonio Conte and his players had applied themselves in those games in the same motivated way they have done recently, the results would surely have been different and the Blues would now have the upper hand as far as Champions League qualification is concerned. After the Liverpool game, while it was nice to hear Conte and star man Eden Hazard respectively talking about applying pressure on their rivals and \"giving everything\", the polite version of the thoughts of many fans was along the lines of: \"Great, but it\'s too late and it doesn\'t excuse what has gone before.\"\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   If Chelsea play like they have done recently they should not only beat Huddersfield and Newcastle but may very well get the better of Manchester United in the FA Cup final as well. There was a sense against Liverpool that Conte was trying out a template for the Wembley showdown with United. The Italian has tweaked his previously favoured 3-4-3 set up into a much more robust-looking 3-5-2 and against Jurgen Klopp\'s dynamic attacking side the system worked perfectly.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Chelsea have climbed their way back into the top-four picture. \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The backline of Cesar Azpilicueta, captain Gary Cahill and Antonio Rudiger with the safe hands of Thibaut Courtois behind them were cohesive and forceful. In midfield N\'Golo Kante and a rejuvenated Tiemoue Bakayoko bristled with ball-winning energy which afforded Cesc Fabregas the opportunity to be more creative with his distribution, meaning wing-backs Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso saw plenty of the ball as did Hazard. Freed of defensive duties, he was a constant menace and his link-up play with striker Olivier Giroud looked intuitive at times.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Giroud\'s expert header from a well-timed Moses cross which won the game wasn\'t the only goal-scoring chance Chelsea created. Finishing remains an issue but the overall performance suggested this was a team that could play as a unit, soak up pressure, counter attack and score goals.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   As well as earning plaudits for his tactical nous, Conte also deserves credit for recognising that Cahill and perhaps Giroud have the added motivation to do well in order to be selected for their respective countries\' World Cup squads. Cahill is playing with a degree of authority required from a captain that has been previously lacking when Chelsea have faltered while Giroud has the swaggering confidence the Blues have missed since Diego Costa departed. Conte has also restored the confidence of 23-year old Bakayoko, whose form had floundered after a promising start to his Chelsea career following his Â£40 move from Monaco last summer.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   What the future holds for Conte as Blues boss remains unclear, but the 48-year-old still has over 12 months to run on his contract. And with Chelsea now seemingly reunified under his stewardship and no clear favourite emerging to succeed him should he depart or be fired, victory in the FA Cup could yet see him in charge of first team affairs at the Bridge next season. If by some stroke of good fortune qualification for the Champions League has also been secured, Conte staying would be a bit of a no brainer.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Certainly among the match-going fraternity there remains plenty of love for the Italian. And if the team are playing well, maybe a case of better the devil you know will work best a while longer for all parties. That includes Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich who will save himself approaching Â£10 million if he chooses not to terminate Conte\'s contract.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-09 07:49:32', 'APPROVED'),

(102, 2, '102.jpg', '&quot;Why I Succeed&quot; - Michael Jordan', '\n<p>\n   Hello fellow RoarConnect users. I am Ifechukwu, your RoarConnect blogger for basketball updates. I will be updating you with basketball news, events, and gist within Nigeria and around the World. It doesn\'t matter whether you are a basketball fan or not, the updates from this platform are for you.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   As a start, today, I will share with you a very inspiring quote from Michael Jordan. When you hear the word, \"Basketball,\" I am sure that the name that comes to your mind is \"Michael Jordan.\" I will not blame you for that. Michael Jordan attained so much success in the game that it will not be an overstatement to say that he is the god of basketball. But, what is the secret of his success? How did Michael Jordan ever come to the level of making the impact he made in basketball? Well, I came across a video where Michael Jordan revealed the secret. I uploaded the video on my Facebook page. You can <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ife.ejiofor/videos/990451441131938/\" target=\"_blank\">click on this link to watch it</a>. \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The words in video are outlined below. The words are very deep. Read with understanding:\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   ****************************\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   <em>I\'ve missed more than <b>9000</b> shots in my career.</em>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   <em>I\'ve lost almost <b>300</b> games.</em>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   <em><b>26</b> times I\'ve been trusted to take the game winning shot, I missed.</em>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   <em><b>I have failed</b> over, and over, and over again in my life.</em>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   <em><b>And that is why I succeed</b>.</em>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   ****************************\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   My best part is when he said \"<em>And that is why I succeed</em>.\" You see, Michael Jordan succeeded simply because he had failed \"<em>over, and over, and over again</em>.\"\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   I know that many of us have heard so many other similar quotes like this. We have heard them so many times that we now take it as a cliche that failure is an essential ingredient for success. For me, If there is anything I learnt from the above words of Michael Jordan, it is that this basic truth is not a cliche. It cannot be cliche. If it were, it wouldn\'t have worked for Michael Jordan.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Since Michael Jordan succeeded because he failed, I have made a resolution that I will go out, strive to fail \"<em>over, and over, and over again</em>\" so that I will succeed. This is my resolution. Won\'t you make a similar resolution?\n</p>\n', 54, '2018-05-09 12:53:20', 'APPROVED'),

(105, 1, '105.jpg', 'Chelsea hopes of Champions League delays till final game', '\n<p>\n   A belated revival had allowed Chelsea to believe they might salvage a season of setbacks with Champions League qualification, but they found themselves peripheral characters in Huddersfield\'s fairy-tale survival script at Stamford Bridge.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Conte\'s men began with purpose and a degree of fluency despite his decision to make six changes from the team that beat Liverpool, but the visitors\' obstinate game plan soon sent the match into a tedious drift, punctuated only by the frequent fury of Stamford Bridge at Lee Mason\'s officiating.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Alvaro Morata created the only chance of the first half for himself, letting an N\'Golo Kante pass run across his body and rounding Jonas Lossl, only to find that he had taken himself too wide to score. Soon after the break, an unmarked Antonio Rudiger headed over from Willian\'s free kick and exasperation grew.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It was replaced by desperation when, in the 50th minute, the giant Laurent Depoitre raced onto Aaron Mooy\'s lofted pass, bounced Willy Caballero to the ground and tapped the rebound into an empty net. Thibaut Courtois, sitting out with a minor back injury, might have gotten to the ball quicker.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard, rested from the start, soon entered the fray, but Chelsea\'s equaliser was not borne of design; Zanka\'s attempted clearance from his own penalty area struck Marcos Alonso in the face and went in.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Chelsea poured forward, abandoning all formation and composure in search of a winner. They came closest in an almighty penalty box scramble in which Andreas Christensen\'s header was tipped onto the post and a seemingly never-ending wave of blue shots found only heroic red bodies.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The noise grew louder, Huddersfield stood firm, and a huge roar from the away end greeted Mason\'s whistle confirming the Terriers\' Premier League survival. Only a Brighton win at Anfield can rescue Chelsea\'s hopes of Champions League football now, and you sense not even Conte thinks his team would deserve such fortune.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-10 06:37:24', 'APPROVED'),

(107, 1, '107.jpg', 'Arsenal lose again away from Home', '\n<p>\n   Another away match in 2018 and another away defeat for Arsenal. Their seventh in a row looked inevitable after a crazy two early minutes in which Kelechi Iheanacho scored for Leicester and then, almost immediately, brought about the dismissal of centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos. Arsenal\'s 10 men hit back through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but were undone 16 minutes from time by a Jamie Vardy penalty and, at the end, a late Riyad Mahrez strike.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   If the Gunners cannot put a stop to their dismal form on the road at Huddersfield on Sunday, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger\'s reign will end with a whimper.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Arsenal got off to a nightmare start. They had controlled the opening 12 minutes but Leicester\'s first period of danger produced a double blow that proved terminal. The away side appeared to have survived when Petr Cech turned Vardy\'s angled drive around his near post, but the resulting corner was never properly cleared and Iheanacho, perfectly placed to meet Fousseni Diabate\'s astute header, rifled home crisply.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Within 92 seconds, Arsenal\'s quandary intensified when young centre-back Mavropanos hauled Iheanacho over after the forward had charged down his clearance. Iheanacho was some 45 yards from goal but his pace looked likely to take him clear; it was the kind of decision some referees compromise upon but Graham Scott brandished the red card unflinchingly.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   That sequence put Leicester firmly on the front foot, although Arsenal somehow survived further punishment before the interval and came mighty close to a 34th-minute equaliser when Eldin Jakupovic, making his Premier League debut for the Foxes, made a brilliant one-handed save to deny Henrikh Mkhitaryan.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Arsenal came even closer with the first action of the second half, Sead Kolasinac rattling the near post with a fierce strike, before quickly thanking substitute Shkodran Mustafi for hacking Diabate\'s half-saved shot off the line. But in the 52nd minute their clear improvement brought an equaliser, with Aubameyang blasting home at the second attempt after fine work down the right by Ainsley Maitland-Niles.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The goal appeared to take the sting out of Leicester, who had worked Cech enough times that they should have been out of sight before the break. Yet 16 minutes from time, the hosts found a winner out of the blue after Mkhitaryan clipped the substitute Demarai Gray in the box. Arsenal protested but the contact, with man and not ball, seemed clear enough. Vardy converted and then, with a minute to go, Mahrez ran clear down the right before finishing coolly.\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-10 06:53:06', 'APPROVED'),

Now be believe we can do it.\"\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   This 2017-18 Marseille team is not the most talented in the club\'s history. It is nowhere near as strong as the 1991 one, with Chris Waddle or Jean-Pierre Papin, the 1993 one that boasted Marcel Desailly, Rudi Voller or Didier Deschamps; it\'s not even at the level of the 1999 one that lost 3-0 to Parma in the UEFA Cup, with Laurent Blanc or Robert Pires, or the 2004 one.

Their numbers this season are fantastic. Thauvin is having the best campaign of his career. At 25, he has finally matured. He is consistent, efficient and has been involved in 42 goals this season (26 goals in all competitions, including 22 in Ligue 1 and 16 assists). Payet started slowly and had a couple of injuries but is finishing strongly.

And as he has demonstrated in the Chinese Super League so far this term, he remains capable of making a decisive impact in the final third as well.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \"This team remains inordinately reliant on its spine of Leon Balogun, John Obi Mikel and Victor Moses.

They live in a perpetual goldfish bowl of endorsements, global tours and branding, much of it dutifully chronicled on social media. They are the established act, the aging rockers on their umpteenth victory tour and no matter if, for this last performance, one or maybe even two of them might make way for a backing artist.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   They remain the \"BBC\" -- Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo -- and they\'re the blunt attacking force that could turn Real Madrid into European champions for the fourth time in five years. It\'s something nobody has achieved since, well, Madrid themselves more than half a century ago.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The other is a rising boy band who few would have even conceived of when the \"BBC\" super-group was assembled five years ago. Sadio Mane was in Austria and had yet to see a minute of European football. Roberto Firmino was playing in midfield for Hoffenheim. And Mohamed Salah, the last piece of the puzzle, had finished his first season in Europe, at Basel, mostly coming off the bench. There\'s no catchy acronym but you\'ll find plenty of the \"heavy metal football\" their coach, Jurgen Klopp, craves.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   These two attacking forces are set for a showdown in the Champions League final when Real Madrid take on Liverpool, the Establishment vs. the Upstarts.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   With these men, it\'s not just about where they are; it\'s about where they come from. Real Madrid\'s trio are all blue-bloods who were tipped for greatness before they turned 20. Bale moved to Tottenham Hotspur at 18 for $10 million back when that was still a lot of money. Benzema had been capped by France and was the crown jewel at Olympique Lyonnais. Ronaldo was the apple of Sir Alex Ferguson\'s eye in Manchester United\'s Theatre of Dreams.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   As for Liverpool\'s trio, when they were still teenagers? Mane was at Metz in the French second division, where he scored a single goal in 19 games. Firmino was at Figueirense, helping them earn promotion to the Brazil top flight. Salah? He had made his first appearances for Egypt\'s El Mokawloon but hadn\'t been playing much at all since the Port Said tragedy in 2012 brought the league to a halt.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Yet even pedigree must succumb to the passage of time. In terms of the \"BBC,\" this has been the toughest season yet. Bale, beset by injuries, missed chunks of the past two seasons and was dropped for the Champions League final last year. Benzema, once considered untouchable as the workhorse who made those around them look good -- and sometimes to the chagrin of purists who judged him solely by his goals total -- is by no means an automatic choice.

(143, 1, '143.jpg', 'United Fans wants Liverpool to lose in Champions League Final', '\n<p>\n   An hour after the 2005 Champions League final, I received a text message from a Liverpool-supporting friend who was sat behind the goal in Istanbul. It read: \"I know how you felt in Barcelona.\" There was no gloating that his side had just won a fifth European Cup, just a genuine admission after one of the highlights of his life.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   For Manchester United fans, the game had been going so well as Milan, widely regarded as the best team on earth, raced into a 3-0 half-time lead. Imagine the mood among defeated supporters on their long journey home to Liverpool? It gave me pleasure to anticipate their pain because, while schadenfreude is a German word, it has strong currency among football fans. Who doesn\'t enjoy seeing their rivals lose?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Then Liverpool scored three times in six minutes after the break, before netting three shootout penalties to Milan\'s two. For 13 years since, United fans have been given the \"five\" salute whenever the two English rivals teams have played each other. I hope it doesn\'t become six on Saturday night in Kiev, but do feel conflicted.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   I am envious that Liverpool are in a European Cup final and United are not. I was envious at the sight of their players celebrating in front of a massive away following in Rome, one which seemed to stretch for miles, having reached the final, because United fans know how good that feeling is. I am also envious of the thousands, who will undertake a great adventure to Kiev and respect anyone who travels so far to watch their team.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   I know enough Liverpool fans and they\'re not that different to my friends in Manchester. They are working class lads from England\'s North West who love their football. Give me a proper football supporter over a corporate fat cat with a category one ticket and paid-for hotel room.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   British supporters will go the extra mile to see their team, even if it involves completely irrational behaviour. Liverpool had 5,000 in Rome for their semifinal second leg, whereas Barcelona took 500 in the previous round. Atletico Madrid didn\'t sell out their Europa League final allocation last week, while Real Madrid have returned tickets for Saturday\'s game.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Liverpool and Madrid fans are not the first to have logistical issues when getting to a European final and UEFA have promised that more thought will go into the suitability of further venues. I have no problem with the games being played away from repeated visits to London, Paris, Berlin and Rome, but host cities must be able to host big numbers without charging â‚¬500 for a hotel room.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Around 20,000 Liverpool fans will travel, as well as 20,000 flags if the buildup seen on social media is anything to go by. You know the type, self-aggrandising statements rather than factual ones like \"No league title since 1990\" or \"We sell our best players to Barcelona\" and \"We nearly won the league in 2014.\" Instead they crowbar in puns playing off \"Chicken Kiev.\" Or \"shickin\' as they might say it...\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It\'s the culture and some of them are more original in design than the monotony of red, white and black tricolours at United games. And the best have humour. In the 1980s, one Liverpool flag simply read: \"Atkinson\'s long leather.\" It was a fantastic dig at the sartorial outlandishness of the then-United manager, Ron Atkinson, who happens to be Liverpool-born.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   I don\'t want Liverpool to win on Saturday. Or Real Madrid. Why would I? I live in hope that my club will one day catch Liverpool\'s five and Madrid\'s 12 European Cups. It seems a long way off but, when I started going to away games with United they had seven English titles, compared with Liverpool\'s 18. And now they have 20.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   I don\'t subscribe to the argument that you should want a team from the same country to do well. Why would I? Their success is our pain. The mother of an ex-girlfriend couldn\'t understand why I didn\'t want other English teams to win if United weren\'t playing, but she was from a generation that watched United one week and Manchester City the next. Not that everyone shared the same view: My father is so trenchant in his view of Liverpool that he refuses to step foot in what is now a fine city.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It\'s tribal, trivial and entertaining, just as football should be. I know a 62-year-old, who lives in Manchester -- let\'s call him Bob, for that\'s his name -- who watches Liverpool home and away. Yet he refuses to go to Old Trafford. He doesn\'t like the nastiness of the atmosphere and he doesn\'t want to give United any money. Bob is originally from Warrington, that no-man\'s land between the two cities that falls into what Liverpool fans call \"wool\" territory.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Enough information seeps past internal privacy settings for me to know that Liverpool have had a great run to the final and that Jurgen Klopp is the type of manager you love when he\'s at your club and find nauseous when he\'s managing your rivals.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   And so I\'m conflicted watching\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-25 04:17:52', 'APPROVED'),
(144, 1, '144.jpg', 'Liverpool fast Start and Real Madrid late pressure might decide UCL final', '\n<p>\n   Saturday\'s Champions League final offers one of the most fascinating tactical clashes in recent memory: Jurgen Klopp\'s Liverpool, with their astute, intensive, counter-pressing approach, meet the more laissez-faire style of Zinedine Zidane\'s Real Madrid, who concentrate upon possession play.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It has all the makings of a superb match. Here are four key questions waiting to be answered.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   1. What formation will Zidane use?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The most remarkable thing about Real Madrid\'s Champions League record under Zidane is the sheer number of matches they have won despite appearing to be outwitted in terms of game plan. Madrid have repeatedly seemed vulnerable in a certain area, yet individual magic in the final third has saved the day.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   In Kiev, however, they\'re up against a side boasting a comparable level of individual brilliance upfront, and therefore, it feels essential that Zidane\'s side are not second-best in a tactical sense. Liverpool will use their customary 4-3-3, so how will the European Cup holders respond? There are two obvious options.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The first is using the diamond midfield that has generally been Zidane\'s preferred system in the Champions League. Theoretically, that would see Madrid enjoy a numerical advantage in the centre of the pitch, with Isco coming into the lineup alongside Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. There\'s a danger, however, that such a narrow system will make it easier for Liverpool to press and box Madrid into the sides of the pitch when, for example, Real\'s full-backs have the ball.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Therefore, Zidane could use a 4-3-3 system himself. This would probably feature Karim Benzema upfront, with Cristiano Ronaldo as an inside left and Gareth Bale on the right (though Isco, Marco Asensio and Lucas Vazquez could also feature, while Ronaldo played upfront in this alignment at Bayern Munich in the semifinal). This approach would stretch play and target Liverpool\'s full-backs, who have been excellent this season but nevertheless can find themselves isolated.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   2. Can Marcelo cope against Salah?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   While capable of being a key player by pushing forward on the overlap to exploit Ronaldo\'s habit of narrowing the opposition right-back, sometimes Marcelo\'s defensive vulnerability costs his side. He was Brazil\'s worst performer in their infamous 7-1 World Cup semifinal loss to Germany in 2014, and statistics suggest that an increasing number of Real concessions come from his flank.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Salah\'s form this season has been incredible, with the Egyptian forward breaking the Premier League record for goals in a 38-game campaign with 32. But while his strikes have come from a variety of positions, it feels like he\'ll spend the majority of this match in a wide-right role -- especially when Madrid have possession -- waiting to pounce on the counterattack.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   In Liverpool\'s semifinal win vs. Roma, Salah was happy to let the opposition left-back/wing-back Aleksandar Kolarov go free on the overlap, confident that he\'d do more damage on the break than his opposite number. But Marcelo is a more dangerous attacking weapon than Kolarov -- not just a mere crosser and shooter but a genuine playmaker in his own right.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It is likely that Marcelo will need help from Sergio Ramos, Real\'s left-sided centre-back. He has a habit of providing crucial moments in big games in the opposition penalty area but is also excellent in terms of doubling up against a wide player, relying on his experience as a former full-back. If Madrid are to stop Salah, it might be about Ramos\' display as much as that of Marcelo.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   3. Will Liverpool score early?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   A fundamental part of Klopp\'s game plan is for his side to put the opposition under pressure in the early stages. Liverpool effectively won their quarterfinal against Manchester City with three goals in the first 31 minutes, but those early exertions can cost them later in big games: They let Roma back into their semifinal with two concessions in the last 10 minutes of the first leg and twice conceded late in the return game.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The 4-3 Premier League win against Manchester City in January was another telling example: Liverpool forced early pressure in both halves and scored in the ninth minute of the first period, then the 14th, 16th and 23rd of the second. City, though, netted five minutes before half-time, then again in minutes 84 and 90. Liverpool\'s pressure dominated early, but City\'s possession took over by the end.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   It\'s easy to imagine something similar happening vs. Madrid, and it\'s worth remembering that Klopp\'s previous Champions League final appearance, in 2013, also fits the pattern. His Dortmund side took early control against Bayern Munich -- the scoring sequence doesn\'t quite tell the story of the game -- but faded badly late and lost to a last-gasp Arjen Robben winner.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   An early goal for Liverpool would compel Real to push forward and leave Liverpool space -- Klopp\'s side are the best counterattackers in Europe -- into which they can break. But if the English side fail to score in their\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-05-25 04:29:21', 'APPROVED'),

(147, 2, '147.jpg', 'Warrior take the supposed Lead in game 1 Finals', '\n<p>\n   A back-and-forth final five minutes culminated in Cleveland Cavaliers guard George Hill at the free throw line with 4.7 seconds remaining with a chance to win the game. After hitting his first attempt to tie the score, Hill missed his second.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Smith recovered the rebound, but instead of firing up a shot that could have given Cleveland -- a 13-point underdog entering the game -- an unlikely road win, he retreated to the perimeter, thinking the Cavaliers held the lead, waiting for a foul that never came.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   After the game, there were conflicting explanations for Smith\'s play.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \"He thought we were up one,\" said Cavs coach Tyronn Lue. But Smith denied he had gotten the score wrong and defended his play.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \"I was trying to get enough to bring it out to get a shot off,\" Smith told reporters. \"I knew we were tied; I thought we were going to call timeout. If I thought we were ahead, I\'d have held on to the ball and let them foul me.\"\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   By the time Smith realized his mistake and passed, the clock ran out before Hill could get up a shot.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Given the second chance, the Golden State Warriors didn\'t dribble it away. They scored the first nine points of overtime, pulling away for a 124-114 win to take a 1-0 lead in the fourth consecutive NBA Finals matchup between the two teams.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Smith\'s folly overshadowed a dominant performance by James, whose 51 points were a career high in 236 playoff games and the sixth-highest total in Finals history, per ESPN Stats & Information research. Taking advantage of the lateral leg contusion and bone bruise that sidelined Warriors forward Andre Iguodala, Golden State\'s best defensive matchup for him, James started hot -- scoring 12 points on perfect 4-of-4 shooting in the first quarter -- and rarely cooled.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Behind James\' performance and a strong return by Kevin Love, who missed Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals before clearing concussion protocol Thursday afternoon, Cleveland led the bulk of the first half. The Cavaliers led just five minutes combined in double-digit losses at Oracle Arena in Game 1 of the past two Finals, but they held the lead for 19:50 in the first half this time around.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   By the break, however, Golden State had managed to tie the game with a 16-5 run over the final 5:01 of the second quarter, capped by Curry\'s deep 3 -- his longest make of the season, per ESPN Stats & Information research -- to beat the halftime buzzer.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The momentum the Warriors took to the locker room seemed to portend another of their trademark third-quarter explosions. James prevented it, running up 36 points by the midway point of the third. Cleveland trailed by just six heading to the final period.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   There, James scored or assisted on nine of the Cavaliers\' 12 field goals, including a driving layup with 32.1 seconds left that gave Cleveland a 106-104 lead.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   At the other end, Curry responded with a 3-point play that put the Warriors ahead with 23.5 seconds left. James held the ball at the top of the key, running the clock down for a final shot when Klay Thompson fouled a cutting Hill away from the ball, sending him to the line for two shots and setting up a finish to regulation no one watching will ever forget.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   To cap the bizarre ending, Tristan Thompson was ejected with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime after a confrontation over Thompson\'s aggressive contest on a meaningless Shaun Livingston shot, which earned him a flagrant 2 foul.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \"Shaun\'s a smart player, has been in the league for a long time,\" Thompson said. \"I played with Shaun so he knows. But he shot the shot, he wanted to increase his points per game, that was some bulls---. But, I just did a contest.\"\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The end of regulation will take its place among a handful of similar famous finishes.

(148, 1, '148.jpg', 'Zidane\'s departure! A SHOCKER', '\n<p>\n   Zinedine Zidane\'s departure from Real Madrid after two and a half seasons did not come as a complete bolt from the blue. The Frenchman had hinted earlier in the season that exhaustion was setting in due to the demands of coaching the club but it will be a tough proposition for whoever replaces him to replicate the Frenchman\'s incredible haul of trophies at the Bernabeu, although Zidane\'s compatriot Arsene Wenger has put himself front and centre for the gig.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Zidane leaves with nine titles from 13 contested during his reign nestled in the club\'s museum and his name will live long in the memory of Madridismo. Only one coach, the legendary Miguel Munoz, won more with Madrid and he required 14 seasons to land 14 trophies. Doubtless, Zidane would swap a few Super and Club World Cup trinkets for a couple of Munoz\'s nine Liga triumphs but the 45-year-old has written his own history at Madrid during a more competitive era.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   No manager in the history of the game has won three consecutive European Cup/Champions League titles and the Frenchman has every right to draw a line under an unprecedented period of success in the big-bucks era on a high.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Here we take a look at five highlights from Zidane\'s 29-month tenure as Madrid boss.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Zidane\'s first Clasico\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Jose Mourinho sat ashen-faced in the Camp Nou dugout as Barca hammered his nascent Madrid project 5-0 in the infamous \"manita\" Clasico of 2010-11. Carlo Ancelotti\'s debut in the eternal rivalry came 10 games into the 2013-14 season and he left Camp Nou on the wrong end of a 2-1 scoreline. For Zidane it was lucky 13 in La Liga as he took his side to Catalonia and returned with three points after a 2-1 victory, an instant declaration of intent after four Madrid defeats in five previous Clasicos and the turning point for a demoralised Real in 2015-16. Zidane took over a side four points adrift of a rampant Barcelona after 18 games and dragged them to within a point of the eventual champions after 38, a clear sign of the wind changing direction after four years of Liga blanks.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   The Undecima in Milan\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Few could argue that Zidane had a fairly easy ride to the 2015-16 Champions League, but as a novice coach he rode his luck and galvanised a squad that had topped their group over PSG but faced little other competition with Malmo and Shakhtar making up the numbers. Roma were dispatched with relative ease but Wolfsburg was a different matter entirely, a ball-shaped hole in the Germans\' wall allowing a Cristiano Ronaldo free kick to slip through to settle a tense tie.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Manchester City opted for an ultra-defensive approach and conceded once -- a deflected Gareth Bale cross/shot forcing an own goal from Fernando -- over 180 minutes. Atletico Madrid were typically resolute and beaten on only penalties in the San Siro, but it was a watershed moment for Zidane. Ancelotti had delivered the long-obsessed over Decima after a 12-year wait. It took Zidane six months (with a nod to Rafa Benitez) to deliver the 11th two years later.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Zinedine Zidane amazingly led Real Madrid to three UCL titles in less than three years. Photo credit should read FRANCK FIFE/AFP/Getty Images\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   La Liga glory, 2016-17\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Zidane described his only league title as his greatest achievement in his farewell news conference and not without good reason. The Champions League is a crapshoot but the 38-game format in Spain, despite external sniffing to the contrary, is not a case of shooting fish in a barrel and winning the Clasico.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Dethroning reigning champions Barca, who had completed a domestic double the season before, and holding a typically dogged Atletico at arm\'s length was no mean feat and Zidane did so with just three defeats, 106 goals scored and holding top spot for 28 of 38 match weeks. Only Sevilla, Valencia and Barcelona were able to take three points off his side, who scored four or more on 10 occasions.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Real\'s scoring record\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   From a goalless draw against Manchester City in April 2016 to the 1-0 home defeat to Betis in September 2017, Zidane\'s Madrid netted in 73 consecutive games in all competitions to beat Bayern Munich\'s European record of 61 while also matching Santos\' mark of the same number from 1963. Only River Plate have hit the net in more consecutive games, embarking on a 96-game sequence between 1936 and 1939.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Zidane won\'t be remembered as a defensive mastermind at the Bernabeu but when his side clicked they were excellent value for your money: Real scored five or more in 15 Liga games during that record-breaking run and three or more eight times in Europe.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Zidane\'s European treble\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   \r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n   Ensuring his place in the history books as the most successful manager of all time in Europe\'s elite club competition, Zidane is the only coach to have lifted old big ears three times in succession and only the third to win it that many times overall, alongside Bob Paisley and Ancelotti. En route to glory in Kiev, Zidane masterminded 180-minute victories over PSG, Juventus and Bayern Munich and beat Liverpool -- who\n</p>\n', 4, '2018-06-01 05:14:43', 'APPROVED');
